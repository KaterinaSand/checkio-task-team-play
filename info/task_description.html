<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    Two teams of robots are playing the game of <i>cut-or-bend</i>. 
	The rules of the game are very simple:
	<ul>
		<li>
		The team that has processed more details than its opponent is
		the winner.
		</li>
		<li>
		A detail is considered to be processed if it is either bent or cut.
		</li>
		<li>
		Each robot is able to bend and cut but during the game it can perform
		only one function.
		</li>
		<li>
		Each team consists of N players, K of them must be occupied with cutting. 
		All the rest must be occupied with bending. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	Suppose you are the coach of one of these teams. You are given two lists of
	of positive integers both of size N representing stats of your team. The i-th
	value in the first list is the number of details which can be cut by the i-th
	member of the team during the game. Similarly the i-th value in the second list 
	is the number of details which can be bent by the i-th member of the team during 
	the game. Knowing the value of K calculate the maximum score which can 
	be obtained by your team.

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> 
	Three arguments. Two lists of integers of equal size representing team's stats. 
	An integer - number of team's members that has to be occupied with cutting.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> 
	An integer - maximum score which can be obtained by the team.

    <i>
	This is a discrete optimization puzzle. As Leonhard Euler has stated,
	"Nothing in the world takes place without optimization, and there is no 
	doubt that all aspects of the world that have rational basis can be 
	explained by optimization methods."
